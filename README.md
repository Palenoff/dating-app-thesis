# Mock Dating App for Master Thesis Data Collection
Welcome to the Mock Dating App repository! This project was developed as a tool for collecting data for my Master's thesis for a degree in Social Sciences for a Digital Society at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.
The app simulates a simplified version of a dating platform, allowing users to assess a randomly complied set of dating profiles based on their authenticity, attraciveness, and trustworthiness.

The frontend code was developed by ChatGPT.

# Procedure
Upon accessing the app, users will be prompted to fill out a short registration form.
After registration, users will be directed to the swiping session interface.
In the swiping session, users will be presented with 10 randomly generated profiles.
For each profile, users are asked to assess its authenticity, attractiveness, and trustworthiness.
Once the swiping session is completed, users are notified that some of the profiles were generated by ChatGPT.
